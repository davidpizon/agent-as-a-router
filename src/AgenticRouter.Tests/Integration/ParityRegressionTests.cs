        // TODO: Add tests that cover the following scenarios:
        // 1. Routing decisions under various inputs (e.g., different prompts, contexts).
        //    - Create an AgentAsARouter instance.
        //    - Provide it with a mock IRouterModelClient.
        //    - Call RouteAsync with different requests.
        //    - Assert that the returned RoutingDecision matches the expected outcome based on Python version's logic.
        //
        // 2. Epsilon-greedy exploration logic.
        //    - Set up RouterMemory with specific scores.
        //    - Run the router multiple times and verify that it sometimes chooses a non-optimal model.
        //    - The frequency should align with the epsilon value in RoutingOptions.
        //
        // 3. Memory updates (learning from observations).
        //    - After a routing decision, call ObserveAsync with a result.
        //    - Check if the RouterMemory is updated correctly (e.g., new score is added, average is recalculated).
        //
        // 4. Handling of unknown dimensions or models.
        //    - Call RouteAsync with a dimension not present in memory.
        //    - Verify that the router handles this gracefully (e.g., by exploring models equally).
        //
        // 5. Equivalence of quality/cost/latency calculations if applicable.
        //    - If the Python version had specific formulas for scoring, ensure the C# version implements them identically.
